Library that implements automatic simplification of algebraic expressions in C#.

To get an idea of the kinds of expressions it handles, see the [tests towards the bottom of this file](https://github.com/dharmatech/Symbolism/blob/master/Symbolism/Program.cs).

The automatic simplification algorithm comes from the book "Computer Algebra and Symbolic Computation: Mathematical Methods" by Joel S. Cohen.
