Library that implements automatic simplification of algebraic expressions in C#.

To get an idea of the kinds of expressions it handles, see the [tests towards the bottom of this file](https://github.com/dharmatech/Symbolism/blob/master/Tests/Program.cs).

The automatic simplification algorithm comes from the book "Computer Algebra and Symbolic Computation: Mathematical Methods" by Joel S. Cohen.

[GiNaC](http://www.ginac.de/) and [SymbolicC++](http://issc.uj.ac.za/symbolic/symbolic.html) are of course very inspirational.
